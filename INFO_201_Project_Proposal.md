### 1.0 Introduction

#### 1.1 Problem Situation.

> The direct stakeholders of the problem situation are government policymakers, real estate developers, and the homeless community. Because of population growth, the shortage of housing supply, and increasing living expenses, the number of homeless population is becoming a problem. It is important to be inclusive in every community in the society in order to close the gap between wealthy people and people who need more resources to survive. Valuing humanity and people’s equal rights play a key role in this case. Public policy implementation of the government and other NGOs that aim to address homelessness problem would help improve the problem if it eventually work out.

#### 1.2 What is the problem?
> Currently, the homelessness issue has been worse than ever in the U.S. With more than five hundred thousand people living on the street, the society is facing severe problems in safety, hygiene, and well-being of the local community. Despite the government's effort in designing policies such as homeless shelter and food bank, the population of homelessness still remains large and alternative solution is needed in order to properly address the problem.  

#### 1.3 Why does it matter?

> It matters because the homeless population will affect citizens’ safety and quality of life in each county. Additionally, the homeless will also affect the county’s environment and GDP. Kids and youth in homeless families are also a big part of the homeless population. A large number of adults homeless might also increase the violence rate of a certain area.

#### 1.4 How it will be addressed?

> We plan to analyze homelessness issue in the United States by county. Specifically, we will address the possible correlation between homelessness and its five major causes that we identified, including housing prices, GDP, education, poverty, and unemployment. We will discuss how are homelessness related to each variable, how they affect each other, and do homelessness relate to them positively or negatively. We will present our result utilizing knowledge we learned in class about data manipulation and visualization.

### 2.0 Research Questions

> RQ 1: What is the current situation of homelessness related to per capita income and housing affordability of real estate in each county of the United States?

>RQ2:  What is the relationship between education level in each county and homelessness and what insights and conclusion could be drawn from it?


### 3.0 Possible data sets
##### Data set 1: Homelessness Statistics by State

> The colored interactive map shows the total number of homeless people by state. By filtering, it also contains the information about statistics of other elements related to homelessness, such as percentages by state and homeless young adults.

Number of observations: 50,
Number of Attributes: 12

##### Data set 2: GDP by County

> “The Bureau of Economic Analysis released prototype statistics for gross domestic product (GDP) by county for 2012-2015. Combined with BEA's county estimates of personal income, GDP by county offers a more complete picture of local area economic conditions.”

Number of observations: 3113,
Number of Attributes: 1

### 4.0 Information Visualization
<br><br />
![visualization 1](https://californiapolicycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/20190620-2-Homeless-Population-by-State-2018.jpg)
This visualization shows the homelessness statistics by state. We are planning to study on the geographic factor and GDP on homelessness.

This graph shows the population in each county. We are planning to create an interactive map for the homeless population in each county.

### 5.0 Team Coordination
a) Each member of our group is committed to meet from 3pm to 5pm every Sundays.

b) Individual goal and roles:
> Jerry: My role in the group is to analyze the problem and datasets, to transform data into helpful knowledge that completes the project and reflect upon different ideas to help the group better coordinate. My goal is to find a problem that we care and is important in real life so that we could work with passion and be proud of it.
<br><br />
Xinye: I would like to gain insights about homelessness issue in the U.S through our research and data visualizations in the project. I help coordinate the team communication and GitHub repository as well as wrangling data.
<br><br />
Clover: Through this project, I hope I can learn more about the causes of the homeless which is a problem that I feel when I came to Seattle. I also hope to learn the application of R with datasets in the real world. My role in the project is helping the team to wrangle the data and revise the whole project.
<br><br />
Yichi: Looking for dataset about homelessness in each county, arranging and wrangling data, and creating data visualization

c) We commit to communicate through group chats as soon as we have thoughts, problems, and insights about the project.

d) We commit to communicate in a timely and straightforward manner. Each member of our group is committed to be aware of our own work breakdowns, and we will communicate frequently to avoid challenges throughout the quarter.
