  "The threat from global terrorism remains high and could worsen over the decade. 
  There are now more Islamist extremists from more countries active in more places than ever before. 
  Globally, terrorism will add to instability and drive international security interventions, 
  especially in the Middle East and Africa. Over the past decade terrorism killed an average of 21,000
  people each year. In addition, terrorist attacks occured in different ways with different types of weapons
  that people have no knowledge of it and no time reacting. These facts are striking to the world suggesting that
  global terrorism is the problem that we humans should be aware of and take initiatives."

background <- (
  "Because of divergent ideologies in politics, culture, and other factors, 
  terrorism is still a threat and a problem to the civil society of some countries. 
  It is important to be inclusive in each society in order to address the potential threat
  of terrorism to the country, regardless of motives, race, and culture. 
  Valuing humanity and people's equal rights play a key role in this issue. Public policy
  implementation of the national government, the United Nations, and other international NGOs
  that aim to address the terrorism problem would help reduce the threat of terrorism if the issue could eventually be mitigated around the world. 
  
  Our group realized that even though terrorism sometimes does not cause a great number of casualties, 
  terrorism provokes deep fear and insecurity more than other forms of violence. Terrorists strike innocent
  civilians randomly and without warning. The national governments think they are capable of protecting their
  citizens against other forms of violence, but all people, in general, feel defenseless against terrorists.
  We would like to analyze the trends of past terrorist attacks to study on the potential correlation among weapons types, 
  attack types, and casualty numbers in the global scope by country over the last twenty years."

  "What is the potential correlations among weapons types, attack types, 
  and casualty numbers in the global scope by country over the last twenty years? "

Vis_2_analysis <- (
  "We can observe from the visualization that the most used weapon types in global terrorist 
  attacks from 2000 to 2018 were explosives, and the second being firearms. The average casualty numbers 
  in the 19 years caused by explosives is approx. 30,568 people. The casualty number caused by explosives 
  had a salient increase from 2012 to 2018: the percentage growth from 2012 to 2013 is 60% in a single year
  and the most casualty caused by explosives occurred in 2015 being 49,000 people. The average casualty numbers
  caused by firearms is approx. 6,710 people. The casualty number caused by firearms fluctuated particularly from 2010 to 2018:
  the percentage growth from 2013 to 2014 is 100% in a single year, but it did not represent the whole trend. Moreover, Melee and
  incendiary are the third and fourth most used in global terrorist attacks, yet the casualty numbers are relatively small compared
  to explosives and firearms. The reason might be that explosives and firearms are more powerful in terms of lethality and
  impacted area; whereas, Melee and incendiary are more likely human conflicts with weapons of less lethality. Vehicle bomb,
  one unique weapon type, was used in 2001 with the casualty number of 2,5000 people; it was probably because of the 911 attack in the US.
  It was used only in one year and cannot be taken into account as a common weapon type."
)

Vis_3_analysis <- (
  "The horizontal bar graph shows the total number of casualties caused by different attack types from
  2000 to 2018. It is easier to compare the total casualties caused by one specific attack type over
  different years. Overall, 2014 has the most casualties in the kidnapping, armed assault; 2017 has the most casualties
  in the unarmed assault; 2015 has the most casualties from lots of different attack types, which indicates 
  that 2015 is the year that a lot of people were injured by the terrorists. There is an outlier in the hijacking, 
  which is the year of 2001. This was probably due to the 911 event that took place in America."
