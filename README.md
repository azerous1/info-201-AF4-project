# info-201-AF4-project

Currently, the homelessness issue has been worse than ever in the U.S. With more than five hundred thousand people living on the street, the society is facing severe problems in safety, hygiene, and well-being of the local community. Despite the government's effort in designing policies such as homeless shelter and food bank, the population of homelessness still remains large and alternative solution is needed in order to properly address the problem.  

Our group project aims to gain insights from data visualizations about the relationship among homeless community and various social factors, such as GDP, educational level, per capita income, real estate supply, and housing prices, etc, in order to analyze the essence of the problem and propose possible solutions.
